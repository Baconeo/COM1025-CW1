		<h2>Past Progamming Experience</h2>
			<p>In my previous school, I was taught python, which has surprisingly similar syntax to Java in some respects. I also had <i>some</i> HTML and CSS experience, but it wasn't taught very well and I sucked at it anyway. So while it probably gave me a bit of an advantage, I've still had to put in a lot of work to correct previous misconceptions and keep up with the teaching pace. And of course, it didn't help with PHP or XML.</p>
